In workshop 3 i learned how to basically make the objects behave naturally. Instead of writing functions and their declarations manually; took a simple class like Account and make it behave like a real world data type. I learned that i can design the class to exist in 3 states like Invalid where bad or irrelevant data makes account unstable; New where categories and fields exists but not assigned yet and at last proper valid data so that objects can be protected from bad data. The concept of Binary operators and how we can turn simple math operators into actions like += to deposit money and use the opposite -= to withdraw which checks like valid account and positive values, basically how operators must enforce rules. Another fun thing was transfer using >> << to move money from right to left or left to right. To conclude i learnt class behaviour and safe indexing and essentially writing natural readable code using objects. On suggestion would be a little explanation on which operators are supposed to alter the object and which are not doing anything.
